strengths and weakness of your overall implementation
I would consider the Microdata Resume Project a success. My first strongest selling point would be content. I have all the necessary content on the page and have included some extra elements which add to the project. The design would probably be my 2nd strongest selling point. I have implemented adequete coloring scheme on the page. The content is clearly layed out and well contrasted in both mobile and desktop view. My biggest weakness is the microdata. I did not dig enough into the microdata structure and how it functions. I might've been able to edit the html to my liking better if I knew what I was looking at.

lessons learned

I learned a lot during this project. I got more familair with boilerplate, learned how to integrate fontawesome icons, utilized things we learned in class such as css grid and media queries to make the webpage more responsive.

things youâ€™d like to improve if you were to start over on the project

If I were to start over on the project, I would dig deeper into microdata and learn how to manipulate it to my liking. I would've also like to mess with css grid and flexbox more since I know I could've made more interesting layouts. I also wanted to include particle js and build a sandwich menu for the mobile view. Hero Patterns is also something I plan on working with in the future since it seems really cool and I am assuming that is what thomaswallace.net's background is running on. 

discussion of the feedback you received and how you addressed those concerns

My peer reviewer enjoyed the design I had going. He also said that I should focus on the content more since I was lacking in that area. I barely made any edits to the content before the review but after the feedback I recevied, I beefed up my content to make it more relevant.
